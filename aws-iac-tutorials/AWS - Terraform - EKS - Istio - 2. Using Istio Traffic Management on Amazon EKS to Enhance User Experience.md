## Traffic Management with Istio on EKS

In this article post, we’ll dive into practical traffic management strategies such as path and weight-based routing, illuminate the concept of traffic mirroring, and venture into advanced scenarios like zone-aware routing.

1. **Traffic Routing using Destination Rules**: Destination rules for traffic routing allow you to control how traffic is directed to different versions or subsets of your microservices.
2. **Weight-Based Routing**: Weight-based routing in Istio controls and distributes traffic intelligently among different versions or subsets of your microservices.
3. **Path-Based Routing**: This creates rules that match specific URL paths and routes them to the appropriate service or subset of services.
4. **Header-Based Routing**: This lets you make routing decisions based on the content of HTTP headers in incoming requests.
5. **Traffic Mirroring**: With traffic mirroring, you will see how to duplicate incoming requests and send a copy to a designated destination for analysis, testing, or monitoring purposes.
6. **Availability Zone Aware Routing**: Last, you will learn about how to enable routing traffic to the pods or services within the same availability zone using the destination rule’s traffic policy.
